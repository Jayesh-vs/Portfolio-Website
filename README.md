# Portfolio Website

I’ve designed and developed this site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my web development skills. It features a curated collection of my projects, each highlighting my ability to write clean code and create user-friendly designs. You’ll also find a contact form to easily reach out, and a downloadable CV for a quick overview of my skills and experience.
